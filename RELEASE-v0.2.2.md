### üë• Enhanced Stakeholder Analysis (v0.2.1)

Comprehensive stakeholder analysis framework that identifies **who** cares about your project and **why**, with complete traceability from drivers to outcomes.

**New Command**: `/arckit.stakeholders`

```bash
/arckit.stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for cloud migration where CFO wants cost savings, CTO wants innovation, and Operations is worried about downtime
```

**Key Features**:

#### 1. **Power-Interest Grid**
Classify stakeholders by engagement strategy:
- **Manage Closely**: High power, high interest (key players)
- **Keep Satisfied**: High power, low interest (influential)
- **Keep Informed**: Low power, high interest (advocates)
- **Monitor**: Low power, low interest (minimal engagement)

#### 2. **Seven Types of Drivers**
Deep analysis of what motivates each stakeholder:
- **STRATEGIC**: Competitive advantage, market position, innovation
- **OPERATIONAL**: Efficiency, quality, speed, reliability
- **FINANCIAL**: Cost reduction, revenue growth, ROI
- **COMPLIANCE**: Regulatory requirements, audit findings, risk mitigation
- **PERSONAL**: Career advancement, workload reduction, reputation
- **RISK**: Avoiding penalties, preventing failures
- **CUSTOMER**: Satisfaction, retention, acquisition

#### 3. **Complete Traceability**
Map from motivations to measurable outcomes:

```
Stakeholder ‚Üí Driver ‚Üí Goal ‚Üí Outcome
   CFO    ‚Üí Cost reduction ‚Üí 40% savings by Q4 ‚Üí ¬£2M annual savings
```

#### 4. **Conflict Analysis & Resolution**
Systematic approach to handling competing stakeholder needs:

**Common Conflicts**:
- **Speed vs Quality**: CFO wants fast delivery vs Operations wants thorough testing
- **Cost vs Features**: Finance wants minimal spend vs Product wants rich features
- **Security vs Usability**: Security wants MFA vs Users want seamless experience
- **Flexibility vs Standardization**: Business wants customization vs IT wants standards

**Resolution Strategies**:
1. **PRIORITIZE**: Choose one stakeholder over another (with justification)
2. **COMPROMISE**: Find middle ground that partially satisfies both
3. **PHASE**: Satisfy both but at different times (MVP vs Phase 2)
4. **INNOVATE**: Find creative solution that satisfies both

#### 5. **RACI Matrix**
Document decision authority for governance:
- **Responsible**: Who does the work
- **Accountable**: Who makes the final decision
- **Consulted**: Who provides input
- **Informed**: Who needs to know

**Template**: `templates/stakeholder-drivers-template.md` (400+ lines)

### üîÑ Updated Requirements Workflow

**CRITICAL CHANGE**: Stakeholder analysis now **MUST** come **BEFORE** requirements.

**Old Workflow** ‚ùå:
```
Principles ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design
```

**New Workflow** ‚úÖ:
```
Principles ‚Üí Stakeholders ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Requirements should address **stakeholder goals**, not invented needs
- Prioritization should reflect **stakeholder power/interest**, not gut feel
- Conflicts between requirements often stem from **stakeholder conflicts**

**Enhanced `/arckit.requirements` Command**:

1. **Checks for stakeholder analysis first**:
   ```
   If stakeholder analysis doesn't exist:
   ‚Üí Strongly recommend running /arckit.stakeholders first
   ```

2. **Traces requirements back to stakeholder goals**:
   ```markdown
   BR-001: Reduce infrastructure costs 40% by Q4 2025
   Rationale: Addresses CFO's goal G-1 (cost reduction driver)
   Stakeholder: CFO (High Power, High Interest)
   ```

3. **Identifies and resolves requirement conflicts**:
   ```markdown
   ## Requirement Conflicts & Resolutions

   ### Conflict C-1: Timeline vs Quality

   **Conflicting Requirements**:
   - FR-001: Deliver MVP in 3 months (CEO driver: market pressure)
   - NFR-Q-002: 95% test coverage (CTO driver: quality standards)

   **Trade-off Analysis**:
   | Option | Pros | Cons | Impact |
   |--------|------|------|--------|
   | Prioritize Speed | ‚úÖ Meet market window | ‚ùå Higher bugs | CEO happy, CTO concerned |
   | Prioritize Quality | ‚úÖ Quality reputation | ‚ùå Miss market | CTO happy, CEO frustrated |
   | Compromise | ‚úÖ Balance | ‚ùå Neither fully satisfied | Both somewhat satisfied |
   | Innovate | ‚úÖ Automated testing | ‚ùå Higher cost | Both satisfied if works |

   **Decision**: INNOVATE - Invest in automated testing pipeline
   **Rationale**: Pays off long-term, satisfies both stakeholders
   **Decision Authority**: CTO (per RACI matrix)
   **Impact**: FR-001 timeline extended to 4 months, NFR-Q-002 achieved via automation
   ```

4. **Documents stakeholder management**:
   - Who "won" and who "lost" in conflicts
   - How to communicate with losing stakeholders
   - What was deferred to future phases

**Template**: Updated `templates/requirements-template.md` with conflict resolution section

## üéì Key Learnings

### Why Stakeholders Come Before Requirements

**The Problem**: Traditional requirements gathering often starts with "what do we need?" This leads to:
- ‚ùå Requirements driven by personal opinions, not stakeholder goals
- ‚ùå Arbitrary prioritization based on gut feel
- ‚ùå Conflicts discovered late when stakeholders review
- ‚ùå Poor stakeholder buy-in because their needs weren't understood

**The Solution**: Start with "who cares and why?"
- ‚úÖ Requirements trace to real stakeholder goals
- ‚úÖ Prioritization based on stakeholder power/interest
- ‚úÖ Conflicts identified early from stakeholder analysis
- ‚úÖ Strong buy-in because stakeholders see their goals addressed

**Example**:

**Bad (Old Way)**:
```
Requirement: "System must have <2 second response time"
Why? "Because fast is good"
Priority? "HIGH because I think it's important"
```

**Good (New Way)**:
```
Requirement: "System must have <2 second response time"
Why? "Addresses Product Manager's goal G-3: Improve conversion rate 25%"
Context: "PM's driver D-2: Competitive pressure (STRATEGIC, HIGH intensity)"
Evidence: "PM's research shows 1-second delay = 7% conversion drop"
Priority: MUST (PM is High Power, High Interest stakeholder)
Conflict: None (CISO wants security, no conflict with performance)
```
