# ArcKit v0.4.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2025-10-28
**Release Type:** Minor Release (Major Feature + Comprehensive Documentation)
**Previous Version:** v0.3.6

---

## üéØ Theme: "Plan First, Execute Right"

This release introduces **comprehensive project planning** capabilities and **extensively expanded documentation** to help enterprise architects plan and execute complex projects with confidence.

---

## üöÄ Major New Feature: Project Planning Command

### `/arckit.plan` - Start Every Project with a Plan

**THE BIG ONE**: Create comprehensive, gate-driven project plans with visual timelines following UK Government GDS Agile Delivery methodology.

#### Why This Matters

Before v0.4.0, architects jumped straight into stakeholders and requirements. Now you start with a **complete project plan** that:
- Shows the entire journey from Discovery to Live
- Identifies when to run each ArcKit command
- Provides governance gates with approval criteria
- Adapts to your project's complexity
- Visualizes dependencies and critical paths

#### What It Generates

**1. Executive Summary**
- Project objectives and success criteria
- Duration, budget, and team sizing
- Key milestones and delivery model

**2. Mermaid Gantt Chart**
- Visual timeline across all four GDS phases
- Activities with dependencies and durations
- Gate milestones (Discovery, Alpha, Beta assessments)
- Start dates and critical path

**3. Workflow & Gates Diagram**
- Flowchart showing decision points
- Approval paths (‚úÖ Approved / ‚ùå Rejected)
- Feedback loops (Refine HLD, Fix Issues, etc.)
- Complete project lifecycle visualization

**4. Phase-by-Phase Activity Tables**
- Discovery: Stakeholders, BRs, principles, business case (Weeks 1-8)
- Alpha: Detailed requirements, HLD, vendor procurement, threat model (Weeks 9-20)
- Beta: DLD, implementation sprints, testing, UAT (Weeks 21-40)
- Live: Deployment, hypercare, benefits realization

**5. ArcKit Command Integration**
- Maps every command to specific weeks
- Shows when to run `/arckit.stakeholders`, `/arckit.requirements`, etc.
- Integrates design reviews at HLD and DLD gates

**6. Approval Criteria**
- Checklists for Discovery Assessment gate
- Checklists for HLD Review gate
- Checklists for Alpha Assessment gate
- Checklists for DLD Review gate
- Checklists for Beta Assessment (Go/No-Go)

#### Intelligent Context Awareness

The plan command **reads existing project artifacts** to tailor the timeline:

```bash
# Reads if they exist:
projects/{project}/stakeholder-analysis.md  ‚Üí Impacts Discovery complexity
projects/{project}/requirements.md          ‚Üí Impacts Alpha/Beta duration
.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md   ‚Üí Identifies compliance needs
projects/{project}/business-case.md         ‚Üí Informs budget constraints
projects/{project}/risk-register.md         ‚Üí Highlights timeline risks
```

**Result**: Plans are customized to YOUR project, not generic templates.

#### Project Complexity Classification

**Small Projects (3-6 months)**:
- < 30 total requirements
- 1-2 external integrations
- Standard technology stack
- Basic security compliance
- Example: Internal dashboard, API integration

**Medium Projects (6-12 months)**:
- 30-100 total requirements
- 3-5 external integrations
- Some custom development
- PCI-DSS/GDPR compliance
- Vendor procurement needed
- Example: Payment gateway, citizen portal

**Large Projects (12-24+ months)**:
- 100+ total requirements
- 5+ integrations
- Significant custom development
- Multiple compliance regimes
- Data migration required
- Example: Digital transformation, NHS appointment system

#### Usage Examples

**Claude Code:**
```bash
/arckit.plan Create project plan for NHS appointment booking system with 12-month timeline

/arckit.plan Create plan for payment gateway modernization including PCI-DSS compliance
```

**OpenAI Codex CLI:**
```bash
/prompts:arckit.plan Create plan for cloud migration with vendor procurement

/prompts:arckit.plan Create plan for HMRC chatbot with 8-month delivery
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
arckit plan Create project plan for patent system modernization

arckit plan Create plan for MOD secure messaging platform
```

#### Output Location

Plans are saved to:
- If project exists: `projects/{project-name}/project-plan.md`
- If no project: `project-plan.md` (root directory)

## üí° Philosophy: Plan First, Execute Right

### Before v0.4.0
Architects often jumped into stakeholder analysis or requirements without a clear roadmap, leading to:
- ‚ùå Unclear timelines and missed deadlines
- ‚ùå Gate approvals as afterthoughts
- ‚ùå No visibility into critical path
- ‚ùå Stakeholders surprised by timeline slippage

### With v0.4.0
Architects start with a comprehensive plan that:
- ‚úÖ Shows the entire journey (Discovery ‚Üí Alpha ‚Üí Beta ‚Üí Live)
- ‚úÖ Identifies when to run each ArcKit command
- ‚úÖ Provides gate approval criteria upfront
- ‚úÖ Visualizes dependencies and critical paths
- ‚úÖ Adapts to project complexity automatically
- ‚úÖ Keeps stakeholders informed with Gantt charts

**Result**: Projects execute with confidence, governance is built-in, stakeholders stay informed.
