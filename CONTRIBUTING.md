# Contributing to ArcKit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ArcKit! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/arc-kit.git
   cd arc-kit
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Types of Contributions

### 1. Bug Reports

If you find a bug, please create an issue with:
- Clear title describing the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Your environment (OS, Claude Code version, etc.)
- Any error messages or logs

### 2. Feature Requests

For new features:
- Explain the use case and problem it solves
- Describe the proposed solution
- Consider UK Government standards compliance
- Discuss alternatives you've considered

### 3. Documentation Improvements

Documentation contributions are highly valued:
- Fix typos or clarify existing guides
- Add examples or use cases
- Improve command descriptions
- Expand troubleshooting sections

### 4. New Commands

To add a new ArcKit command:

1. **Create the command file** in `.claude/prompts/`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Brief description of what the command does
   ---

   Detailed prompt text following ArcKit patterns...
   ```

2. **Follow ArcKit patterns**:
   - Use UK Government standards (GDS, TCoP, Secure by Design)
   - Include comprehensive sections
   - Provide examples and templates
   - Add traceability to other artifacts

3. **Create command guide** in `docs/guides/`:
   - Explain when to use the command
   - Show integration with other commands
   - Document common gaps and fixes
   - Include real-world examples

4. **Multi-AI support**:
   - Add `.codex/prompts/` version (same content)
   - Convert to `.gemini/prompts/` TOML using `scripts/converter.py`

5. **Update documentation**:
   - Add to `.claude/COMMANDS.md`
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Add to `README.md` if major feature

### 5. Code Improvements

For scripts or tools:
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Test thoroughly before submitting
- Update relevant documentation

## Coding Standards

### Command Structure

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** for any changes
2. **Test your changes**:
   - Test with Claude Code
   - Test with Codex CLI (if applicable)
   - Test with Gemini CLI (if applicable)
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** under "Unreleased" section
4. **Create pull request** with:
   - Clear title following commit message convention
   - Description of changes and motivation
   - Reference any related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes

5. **Code review**:
   - Address reviewer feedback
   - Keep discussions focused and professional
   - Be patient - maintainers review when available

## Testing

Before submitting:

1. **Test command execution**:
   ```bash
   claude
   /arckit.your-command Test description
   ```

2. **Verify output quality**:
   - Check all sections are present
   - Verify UK Government standards compliance
   - Ensure traceability references are correct
   - Test with different project scenarios

3. **Check integration**:
   - Run related commands before and after
   - Verify traceability matrix includes new artifacts
   - Test `/arckit.analyze` detects relevant gaps
