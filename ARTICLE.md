# ArcKit: Transforming Enterprise Architecture Governance with AI-Assisted Workflows

**How a free, open-source toolkit is revolutionizing architecture governance, vendor procurement, and strategic planning for enterprise architects**

---

## The Crisis in Enterprise Architecture Governance

Enterprise architects face a silent crisis. Despite decades of investment in expensive tools like Sparx EA, Ardoq, and LeanIX, architecture governance remains fundamentally broken. Documents scatter across Word files, Confluence pages, and PowerPoint decks. Requirements lose traceability to designs. Vendor evaluations introduce bias. Architecture principles exist only as PDFs collecting dust in SharePoint.

The problem isn't lack of tools—it's that these tools weren't designed for the modern, AI-assisted workflow that enterprise architects need today.

Enter **ArcKit**: a free, open-source toolkit that transforms architecture governance from scattered chaos into systematic, AI-assisted workflows. Built on the principles of version control, template-driven quality, and strategic decision-making, ArcKit brings the rigor of software engineering to enterprise architecture.

## What is ArcKit?

ArcKit is an enterprise architecture governance toolkit that provides structured workflows for:

- **Architecture Principles**: Establishing and enforcing organizational standards
- **Requirements Management**: Creating comprehensive, traceable requirements documents
- **Strategic Planning**: Wardley Mapping for build vs buy decisions
- **Vendor Procurement**: Generating RFPs and systematic vendor evaluation
- **Design Reviews**: Formal HLD/DLD validation gates
- **Requirements Traceability**: Automated gap detection and coverage analysis

Unlike traditional EA tools that lock you into proprietary platforms, ArcKit works with your existing AI coding assistant (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI) and stores everything in Git-versioned Markdown files.

## The ArcKit Philosophy: Template-Driven Quality

At its core, ArcKit follows a simple but powerful principle: **structure enables quality**.

Traditional architecture governance fails because it's too freeform. An architect might create a requirements document in Word, but forget to include acceptance criteria. Another might skip security requirements entirely. A third might create principles so vague they're meaningless.

ArcKit solves this through **comprehensive templates** that ensure nothing is forgotten:

- **Requirements templates** force explicit business rationale, acceptance criteria, and success metrics
- **Architecture principles templates** require governance implications and trade-off analysis
- **Vendor evaluation templates** provide unbiased scoring frameworks
- **Design review templates** validate against principles, requirements, and compliance standards

These aren't just blank templates—they're *intelligent prompts* that guide AI assistants to generate high-quality, complete documentation.

## A Typical ArcKit Workflow

Let's walk through a real-world example: modernizing a payment processing system for a financial services company.

### Phase 1: Establish Governance

```bash
# Initialize the project
arckit init payment-modernization --ai claude
cd payment-modernization
claude

# Inside Claude Code
/arckit.principles Create principles for PCI-DSS compliant payment processing
```

Within minutes, you have comprehensive architecture principles covering:
- Cloud-first strategy (AWS/Azure/GCP selection criteria)
- Zero Trust security model
- PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance requirements
- FinOps cost governance
- API-first integration patterns
- Data residency and sovereignty

Each principle includes governance implications, trade-off analysis, and compliance requirements—not just vague aspirational statements.

### Phase 2: Define Requirements

```bash
/arckit.requirements Build a payment gateway that processes credit cards,
supports 10K TPS, complies with PCI-DSS Level 1, integrates with Stripe
and PayPal, and provides real-time fraud detection
```

ArcKit generates 50+ structured requirements across five categories:

**Business Requirements (BR)**: Why we're building this, business value, success metrics

**Functional Requirements (FR)**: What the system must do, with acceptance criteria

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**: Performance (10K TPS), security (PCI-DSS), scalability, compliance

**Integration Requirements (INT)**: Stripe, PayPal, fraud detection APIs

**Data Requirements (DR)**: Transaction data models, PII handling, audit trails

Every requirement includes:
- Clear rationale linking to business objectives
- Measurable acceptance criteria
- Priority level (P0/P1/P2)
- Traceability identifiers for downstream tracking

### Phase 2.5: Strategic Planning with Wardley Mapping

Before rushing into procurement, use strategic situational awareness:

```bash
/arckit.wardley Create current state Wardley Map for payment gateway
showing build vs buy strategy
```

ArcKit generates a Wardley Map analyzing each component by evolution stage:

**Genesis (0.0-0.25)**: Novel, build only if strategic differentiator
- Custom fraud detection algorithm (if competitive advantage)

**Custom (0.25-0.50)**: Bespoke, critical build vs buy decision
- Payment orchestration layer
- PCI-DSS compliance framework
- Multi-provider failover logic

**Product (0.50-0.75)**: Commercial products, buy from vendors
- Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)
- Fraud detection (Sift, Ravelin)

**Commodity (0.75-1.0)**: Utility services, always use cloud
- AWS infrastructure (EC2, RDS, S3)
- Auth0 for authentication
- PostgreSQL database

**Strategic Insights**:
- BUILD: Payment orchestration (Custom, 0.42) - competitive advantage
- BUY: Stripe/PayPal (Product, 0.70) - mature market
- USE: AWS infrastructure (Commodity, 0.95) - no-brainer

The Wardley Map provides a visual representation (via https://create.wardleymaps.ai) and strategic recommendations that prevent the common mistake of building commodity components or buying for Genesis needs.

### Phase 3: Vendor Procurement

With clear requirements and strategic positioning, generate an RFP:

```bash
/arckit.sow Generate RFP for vendor selection with 12-month timeline and $2M budget
```

ArcKit creates a comprehensive Statement of Work including:
- Executive summary with business context
- Detailed scope of work and deliverables
- Technical requirements (all 50+ requirements)
- Vendor qualifications and experience criteria
- Evaluation criteria and scoring methodology
- Contract terms and SLAs
- Timeline and milestones

Then create an unbiased evaluation framework:

```bash
/arckit.evaluate Create evaluation framework
```

This generates a 100-point technical scoring rubric with:
- Requirements coverage (40 points)
- Technical approach (25 points)
- Security and compliance (20 points)
- Implementation quality (15 points)

Plus cost evaluation methodology, reference check templates, and decision matrices.

After receiving proposals:

```bash
/arckit.evaluate Compare all vendors for payment gateway project
```

ArcKit performs side-by-side comparison:
- Technical approach differences
- Cost breakdowns and TCO analysis
- Risk assessments
- Value propositions
- Compliance gaps
- Recommendation with rationale

### Phase 4: Design Review

Once a vendor is selected, validate their high-level design:

```bash
/arckit.hld-review Review Acme Corp's high-level design
```

ArcKit checks:
- **Architecture principles compliance**: Does it follow cloud-first? API-first?
- **Requirements coverage**: Are all 50+ requirements addressed?
- **Security and compliance**: PCI-DSS controls, Zero Trust implementation
- **Scalability and resilience**: Can it handle 10K TPS? Failover strategies?
- **Operational readiness**: Monitoring, alerting, incident response

For implementation-ready validation:

```bash
/arckit.dld-review Review Acme Corp's detailed design for payment service
```

This validates:
- Component specifications and interfaces
- API contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger validation)
- Database schemas and data models
- Security implementation details
- Test strategy and coverage

### Phase 5: Ensure Traceability

Finally, validate complete coverage:

```bash
/arckit.traceability Generate matrix from requirements through design to tests
```

ArcKit produces:
- **Forward traceability**: Requirements → Design → Tests
- **Backward traceability**: Tests → Design → Requirements
- **Gap analysis**: Requirements without design coverage
- **Orphan detection**: Design components not linked to requirements
- **Change impact**: What breaks if a requirement changes?

## Game-Changer: Wardley Mapping Integration

One of ArcKit's most powerful features is native Wardley Mapping support—a strategic visualization technique created by Simon Wardley that maps components by evolution stage.

### Why Wardley Mapping Matters for Enterprise Architecture

Traditional enterprise architecture focuses on *what* to build but struggles with *strategic positioning*:

- Should we build or buy this component?
- Which vendor technology is strategically sound?
- Where are we wasting money building commodity components?
- What's our competitive advantage vs operational overhead?

Wardley Mapping answers these questions by positioning components on an evolution axis:

**Genesis → Custom → Product → Commodity**

### Real-World Example: UK Government Benefits Chatbot

Consider a UK government department building an AI-powered benefits eligibility chatbot:

```bash
/arckit.wardley Create procurement strategy Wardley Map for DWP
benefits eligibility chatbot
```

**ArcKit's Strategic Analysis**:

**BUILD (Genesis/Custom - Competitive Advantage)**:
- Benefits eligibility rules engine (Custom, 0.42) - domain expertise
- Human review queue (Custom, 0.45) - HIGH-RISK AI requirement
- Bias testing framework (Custom, 0.35) - fairness compliance

**BUY (Product - Commercial Market)**:
- GPT-4 LLM (Product, 0.72) - via Azure OpenAI on G-Cloud
- GOV.UK Verify (Product, 0.68) - citizen authentication

**USE (Commodity - Cloud/Utility)**:
- AWS cloud hosting (Commodity, 0.95) - G-Cloud procurement
- PostgreSQL RDS (Commodity, 0.92) - managed database

**REUSE (GOV.UK Services)**:
- GOV.UK Notify (Commodity, 0.92) - email/SMS notifications
- GOV.UK Design System (Product, 0.75) - accessibility compliance

**Strategic Insights**:
- 40% build (where we have competitive advantage)
- 35% buy via G-Cloud (mature commercial products)
- 25% reuse GOV.UK services (avoid duplication)

This strategic positioning prevents costly mistakes like:
- ❌ Building a custom LLM (buying GPT-4 is strategically sound)
- ❌ Building custom notifications (GOV.UK Notify already exists)
- ✅ Building benefits rules engine (domain-specific competitive advantage)
- ✅ Building human review queue (HIGH-RISK AI compliance requirement)

The Wardley Map integrates throughout the ArcKit workflow:
- **Requirements Phase**: Identify component evolution stages
- **Procurement Phase**: Guide build vs buy decisions
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Validate vendor positioning strategically
- **Design Review**: Ensure designs align with strategic positioning
- **Analysis**: Detect misaligned decisions (building commodity components)

## UK Government Support: Built-in Compliance

ArcKit includes comprehensive support for UK Government compliance frameworks—a unique feature for public sector architects.

### Technology Code of Practice (TCoP)

```bash
/arckit.analyze
```

This performs **7 major analysis passes**:

### 1. Requirements Quality Analysis
- Duplication detection
- Ambiguity identification
- Underspecification warnings
- Missing acceptance criteria

### 2. Architecture Principles Alignment
- Principle violations in designs
- Coverage gaps
- Inconsistent application

### 3. Requirements → Design Traceability
- Orphaned requirements (no design coverage)
- Orphaned design components (not linked to requirements)
- Coverage percentage calculation

### 4. Vendor Procurement Quality
- SOW completeness
