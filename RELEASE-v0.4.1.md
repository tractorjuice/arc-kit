# ArcKit v0.4.1 - GDS Compliance & Documentation Expansion

**Release Date**: 2025-10-29
**Type**: Patch Release (Documentation, UI, Compliance)

---

## üé® Major Feature: GOV.UK Design System Website

### Professional GitHub Pages Landing Page

Complete redesign of `docs/index.html` using official GOV.UK Design System:

**GDS Components Implemented:**
- Phase banner with beta tag
- Button components (start, secondary with arrow icons)
- Tag components (green, blue, purple variants)
- Typography system (govuk-heading-*, govuk-body)
- Responsive grid layout (govuk-width-container, columns)
- Warning text and inset text components
- Proper list and link styling

**Design Standards:**
- Official GOV.UK color palette (#1d70b8 brand blue)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Progressive enhancement (js-enabled detection)
- Proper semantic HTML structure

**File Size Optimization:**
- Reduced from 978 lines ‚Üí 542 lines (-436 lines, 45% smaller)
- Minimal custom CSS (only for ArcKit-specific components)
- CDN-hosted GOV.UK Frontend v5.13.0
- Faster loading, professional appearance

## ‚öñÔ∏è Critical Fix: Font Licensing Compliance

### GDS Transport Font Override

**Issue:**
GDS Transport font is licensed ONLY for `*.gov.uk`, `*.service.gov.uk`, `*.blog.gov.uk` domains. ArcKit is hosted on `tractorjuice.github.io` (not authorized).

**Solution:**
```css
/* Explicit system font override per GDS guidelines */
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto,
             Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;
```

**Reference:**
- [GDS Typography Guidelines](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typeface/)
- "If your service is publicly available on a subdomain other than service.gov.uk, use an alternative typeface like Helvetica or Arial."

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Complies with GDS Transport font licensing
- ‚úÖ Uses appropriate system fonts for non-gov.uk domain
- ‚úÖ Maintains professional appearance
- ‚úÖ No console errors from missing font files
- ‚úÖ Transparent footer note explaining font choice

- Types of contributions (bugs, features, docs, commands, code)
- Command structure and standards
- Documentation style (UK English, GOV.UK principles)
- Commit message conventions (conventional commits)
- Pull request process
- Testing guidelines
- UK Government standards compliance (GDS, TCoP, Secure by Design)
- Command naming conventions
- Code of conduct

**Command Contribution Workflow:**
1. Create `.claude/prompts/` file following ArcKit patterns
2. Add documentation in `docs/guides/`
3. Implement multi-AI support (`.codex/`, `.gemini/`)
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `COMMANDS.md`
5. Test thoroughly before submitting PR

**Standards Enforced:**

## üîß Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Refactor: Move converter.py to scripts/

**Change:**
```bash
converter.py ‚Üí scripts/converter.py
```

**Benefits:**
- Better organization (all tools in `scripts/`)
- Consistent with `scripts/bash/` structure
- Updated all references in documentation
- Added comprehensive section to `scripts/README.md`

**Documentation:**
```markdown
### 5. converter.py

**Purpose**: Convert Claude Code commands to Gemini CLI TOML format

**Usage**: `python scripts/converter.py`

**Key Features**:
- Extracts YAML frontmatter from Claude markdown
- Converts description field to TOML format
- Replaces $ARGUMENTS with {{args}} for Gemini syntax
```

### 2. Refactor: Remove Empty File Creation

**Removed from create-project.sh:**
```bash
# REMOVED - commands create files with actual content
touch "$PROJECT_DIR/requirements.md"
touch "$PROJECT_DIR/sow.md"
touch "$PROJECT_DIR/evaluation-criteria.md"
touch "$PROJECT_DIR/traceability-matrix.md"
```

**Rationale:**
- ArcKit commands use Write tool to create files with content
- Empty files serve no purpose
- Reduces confusion during project initialization

### 3. Cleanup: Remove Outdated SETUP.md

**Deleted:**
- `SETUP.md` (329 lines) - development artifact from early phases

**Reasons:**
- Referenced only 8 templates (now 25 commands)
- Had TODOs for already-implemented commands
- Described early development state
- Not linked from anywhere in documentation
- Superseded by README.md, .claude/COMMANDS.md, .codex/README.md

---

## üìä Deployment Summary

### Test Repository Cleanup

**Removed `docs/index.html` from all 8 test repositories:**
- arckit-test-project-v0-mod-chatbot
- arckit-test-project-v1-m365
- arckit-test-project-v2-hmrc-chatbot
- arckit-test-project-v3-windows11
- arckit-test-project-v4-ipa (private)
- arckit-test-project-v5-dstl (private)
- arckit-test-project-v6-patent-system
- arckit-test-project-v7-nhs-appointment

**Rationale:**
- Website hosting only needed in main `arc-kit` repository
- Test projects are for testing ArcKit commands, not hosting website
- Keeps test repos focused and clean

- ‚úÖ 3 Repository links (main, issues, releases)
- ‚úÖ 2 External links (GDS Design System, typography)
- ‚úÖ 2 CDN resources (GOV.UK Frontend CSS/JS v5.13.0)
