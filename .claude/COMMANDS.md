/arckit.traceability Check test coverage for all requirements
```

**What it does**:
- Traces every requirement through design to tests
- Identifies orphan requirements (no design/implementation)
- Identifies orphan design elements (scope creep!)
- Calculates coverage metrics
- Flags critical gaps

**Traceability mapping**:
```
Requirement → HLD Component → DLD Module → Implementation → Tests → Status

Example:
FR-001 → PaymentService → PaymentController.processPayment() → payment.ts → TC-001, TC-002 → ✅
NFR-S-001 → SecurityArchitecture → TokenVault, Encryption → security/ → SEC-001-015 → ✅
BR-003 → [NO MAPPING] → [NO MAPPING] → [NO IMPLEMENTATION] → [NO TESTS] → ❌ GAP!
```

**Coverage metrics**:
- Business Requirements coverage
- Functional Requirements coverage
- Non-Functional Requirements coverage
- Coverage by priority (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- Overall traceability score (0-100)

**Gap analysis**:
- **Orphan Requirements**: Requirements without design (blocking!)
- **Orphan Design**: Design not tied to requirements (scope creep?)
- **Orphan Tests**: Tests not tied to requirements (what are they testing?)
- **Coverage Gaps**: Requirements without tests

**Outputs**:
- `projects/NNN-project-name/traceability-matrix.md` (full matrix)
- `projects/NNN-project-name/coverage-report.md` (metrics)
- `projects/NNN-project-name/gaps.md` (gap analysis)

**When to use**:
- After DLD approval (baseline)
- During implementation (track progress)
- Before release (go/no-go decision)
- For compliance audits (FDA, ISO, automotive)

## Best Practices

### 1. Follow the Workflow

Always follow the recommended sequence:
1. Principles FIRST (establishes governance)
2. Requirements SECOND (defines what you need)
3. SOW/RFP THIRD (procurement)
4. Evaluate vendors
5. HLD review (architecture gate)
6. DLD review (implementation gate)
7. Traceability (verification)

### 2. Keep Principles Updated

Architecture principles should be:
- Living documents (update as you learn)
- Specific enough to enforce
- Flexible enough to allow innovation
- Aligned with industry regulations

### 3. Be Thorough with Requirements

- Every requirement needs unique ID
- Every requirement needs acceptance criteria
- Every "MUST" requirement is mandatory
- Include WHY (rationale) not just WHAT

### 4. Make SOW Legally Sound

- Have legal review before sending to vendors
- Be specific and unambiguous
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Define change management process

### 5. Objective Vendor Evaluation

- Use documented criteria (no arbitrary scores)
- Reference specific requirements
- Document conflicts of interest
- Keep vendor proposals confidential

### 6. HLD is the Architecture Gate

- Implementation cannot start without HLD approval
- All architectural decisions happen here
- Changes after HLD approval require re-review
- Security and compliance are non-negotiable

### 7. DLD is the Implementation Gate

- Coding cannot start without DLD approval
- DLD must be detailed enough for ANY developer
- All ambiguities must be resolved
- Test strategy must be comprehensive

### 8. Maintain Traceability

- Update throughout project lifecycle
- Every MUST requirement MUST be traced to tests
- Use for impact analysis of change requests
- Required for compliance in regulated industries

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Enterprise Architecture Program

```bash
# 1. Establish governance
/arckit.principles Create architecture principles for our enterprise

# 2. For each major initiative, create requirements
/arckit.requirements Create requirements for CRM modernization
/arckit.requirements Create requirements for data platform migration

# 3. Continue with each project...
```

### Pattern 2: Vendor Selection for Project

```bash
# 1. Define requirements
/arckit.requirements Create requirements for payment gateway

# 2. Generate RFP
/arckit.sow Generate SOW for payment gateway project

# 3. After receiving proposals, evaluate
/arckit.evaluate Score Vendor A proposal for payment gateway
/arckit.evaluate Score Vendor B proposal for payment gateway
/arckit.evaluate Compare all vendors for payment gateway

# 4. Select vendor and review designs
/arckit.hld-review Review Vendor A HLD for payment gateway
/arckit.dld-review Review Vendor A DLD for payment gateway

# 5. Track implementation
/arckit.traceability Generate traceability for payment gateway
```

### Pattern 3: Design Review Gate

```bash
# 1. HLD review (architecture decision gate)
/arckit.hld-review Review HLD for project 001

# 2. If approved, move to detailed design
/arckit.dld-review Review DLD for project 001

# 3. If approved, implementation starts

# 4. Before release, verify traceability
/arckit.traceability Check coverage for project 001
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Architecture principles not found"

Run `/arckit.principles` first to establish governance rules.

### "Project doesn't exist"

The command will create the project automatically, or you can specify an existing project number.

### "HLD not approved yet"

DLD review requires HLD approval first. Complete HLD review and address all conditions.

### "Requirements not defined"

Run `/arckit.requirements` before generating SOW or evaluation criteria.

### "Gaps in traceability"

This is expected during implementation. Address CRITICAL gaps (MUST requirements without tests) before release.
