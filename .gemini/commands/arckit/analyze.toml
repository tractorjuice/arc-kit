## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, gaps, ambiguities, and compliance issues across all architecture governance artifacts before implementation or procurement. This command performs **non-destructive, read-only analysis** and produces a structured report with actionable recommendations.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report only.

**Architecture Principles Authority**: The architecture principles (`.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md`) are **non-negotiable**. Any conflicts with principles are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of requirements, designs, or vendor proposalsâ€”not dilution or reinterpretation of the principles.

**UK Government Compliance Authority** (if applicable): TCoP, AI Playbook, and ATRS compliance are mandatory for UK government projects. Non-compliance is CRITICAL.
