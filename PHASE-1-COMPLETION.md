## Detailed Changes

### ✅ 1. evaluate → principles (M) - ADDED

**Problem**: Vendor evaluation wasn't checking governance compliance

**Documentation Fix** (`DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md`):
- Added M dependency in row 23, column 14 (principles → evaluate)
- Updated Tier 5 to include `principles (M)` for evaluate
- Updated artifact summary: principles now consumed by 10 commands (was 8)

**Command Template Fix** (`arckit.evaluate.md`):
- Added MANDATORY prerequisites check (lines 19-41)
- Command now ERRORS if `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md` missing
- Ensures vendor evaluation aligns with organizational governance

**Before:**
```markdown
2. **Read project context**:
   - Read `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md` to ensure alignment...
```

**After:**
```markdown
2. **Prerequisites Check**:

a. **Architecture Principles** (MUST exist):
   - Check if `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md` exists
   - If NOT found: ERROR "Run /arckit.principles first to define governance standards"
   - Vendor evaluation MUST align with organizational governance
```

---

### ✅ 2. dos → principles (M) - ADDED

**Problem**: DOS procurement dependency severity was wrong (marked as R, should be M)

**Documentation Fix** (`DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md`):
- Added M dependency in row 23, column 11 (principles → dos)
- Updated Tier 5 to include `principles (M)` for dos
- Updated artifact summary: principles now consumed by 10 commands

**Command Template Fix** (`arckit.dos.md`):
- Fixed incorrect file path in 3 locations (lines 29, 52, 465)
- Changed `.arckit/templates/architecture-principles.md` → `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md`
- Prerequisite check was already MANDATORY ✓, now points to correct file location

**Evidence**: Command already had correct prerequisite check:
```markdown
a. **Architecture Principles** (MUST exist):
   - If NOT found: ERROR "Run /arckit.principles first to define governance standards"
```

---

### ✅ 3. ai-playbook → requirements (M→O) - CORRECTED

**Problem**: AI Playbook incorrectly required full requirements to run

**Documentation Fix** (`DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md`):
- Changed requirements dependency from M to O in row 27, column 24
- Updated Tier 10 description to show `requirements (O)` for ai-playbook
- Updated artifact summary: requirements consumers now clarify ai-playbook (O)

**Command Template Verification** (`arckit.ai-playbook.md`):
- ✅ Already correct - treats requirements as OPTIONAL
- Line 46: "Read `projects/{project-dir}/requirements.md` (if exists)"
- No code changes needed

**Rationale**: AI Playbook can assess AI principles independently of full requirements. User can describe AI system verbally and get playbook assessment.

---

### ✅ 4. atrs → requirements (M→O) - CORRECTED

**Problem**: ATRS incorrectly required full requirements to run

**Documentation Fix** (`DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md`):
- Changed requirements dependency from M to O in row 27, column 25
- Updated Tier 10 description to show `requirements (O)` for atrs
- Updated artifact summary: requirements consumers now clarify atrs (O)

**Command Template Verification** (`arckit.atrs.md`):
- ✅ Already correct - treats requirements as OPTIONAL
- Line 35: "Read `projects/{project-dir}/requirements.md` (if exists)"
- No code changes needed

**Rationale**: ATRS can be created from user description alone. Requirements enhance output but aren't mandatory for transparency record.

---

## Bonus Fix

### ✅ gcloud-search file path - FIXED

**Problem**: Referenced wrong file path for architecture principles

**Command Template Fix** (`arckit.gcloud-search.md`):
- Fixed incorrect file path in 2 locations (lines 39, 48)
- Changed `.arckit/templates/architecture-principles.md` → `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md`
- Dependency already correctly marked as RECOMMENDED ✓

---

## Artifact Summary Updates

Updated `DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md` artifact consumption statistics:

### principles.md - Now consumed by 10 commands (was 8)
- stakeholders (R)
- risk (R)
- sobc (R)
- requirements (R)
- **dos (M)** ⬅️ NEW
- **evaluate (M)** ⬅️ NEW
- hld-review (M)
- dld-review (M)
- tcop (M)
- secure (M)
- mod-secure (M)
- analyze (M)

### requirements.md - Clarified 22 consumers with severities
- data-model (M), research (M), wardley (M), sow (M), dos (M), gcloud-search (M), evaluate (M), hld-review (M), dld-review (M), backlog (M), diagram (M), servicenow (M), traceability (M), analyze (M), service-assessment (M), tcop (M)
- **ai-playbook (O)** ⬅️ CHANGED from M
- **atrs (O)** ⬅️ CHANGED from M
- secure (M), mod-secure (M), jsp-936 (M), gcloud-clarify (M - implicit)

## Testing Recommendations

Before proceeding to Phase 2, recommend testing:

### 1. Positive Tests
- ✅ Run `arckit.evaluate` WITH principles present → should succeed
- ✅ Run `arckit.dos` WITH principles present → should succeed
- ✅ Run `arckit.ai-playbook` WITHOUT requirements → should succeed (O dependency)
- ✅ Run `arckit.atrs` WITHOUT requirements → should succeed (O dependency)

### 2. Negative Tests
- ⚠️ Run `arckit.evaluate` WITHOUT principles → should ERROR with helpful message
- ⚠️ Run `arckit.dos` WITHOUT principles → should ERROR with helpful message

### 3. Integration Test
- ⚠️ Run workflow: `principles → requirements → dos → evaluate`
- ⚠️ Verify all dependencies resolve correctly

## Impact

### Before These Fixes:
- ❌ Vendor evaluation could run without governance principles (incorrect)
- ❌ DOS dependency severity was wrong (R instead of M)
- ❌ AI Playbook couldn't run without full requirements (too strict)
- ❌ ATRS couldn't run without full requirements (too strict)
- ❌ Multiple commands referenced wrong file paths

### After These Fixes:
- ✅ Vendor evaluation enforces governance compliance (ERRORS if principles missing)
- ✅ DOS procurement enforces governance compliance (correct severity, correct path)
- ✅ AI Playbook can assess principles independently (flexible)
- ✅ ATRS can create transparency records from descriptions (flexible)
- ✅ All commands reference correct file paths

## Files Modified

### Documentation
- `DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md` - Matrix rows 23, 27; Tier descriptions 5, 10; Artifact summaries

### Command Templates
- `.claude/commands/arckit.evaluate.md` - Added prerequisites check
- `.claude/commands/arckit.dos.md` - Fixed file paths (3 locations)
- `.claude/commands/arckit.gcloud-search.md` - Fixed file paths (2 locations)

### Verified Correct (No Changes Needed)
- `.claude/commands/arckit.ai-playbook.md` ✓
- `.claude/commands/arckit.atrs.md` ✓

## Next Steps - Phase 2

**High-Priority Enhancements** (23 gaps remaining)

### Top Priority:
1. **service-assessment** → Add 13 missing dependencies
   - plan (R), data-model (R), principles (R), hld-review (O), dld-review (O), diagram (O), traceability (O), wardley (O), tcop (O), ai-playbook (O), atrs (O), secure (O), mod-secure (O)

2. **plan** → Add 5 missing dependencies
   - stakeholders (O), requirements (O), principles (O), sobc (O), risk (O)

3. **secure** → Add risk (R)
4. **research** → Add stakeholders (R), data-model (R)
5. **tcop** → Add principles (R)

See `DEPENDENCY-GAPS-SUMMARY.md` for complete Phase 2 and Phase 3 lists.
