## üìã Detailed Features

### Visual ERD with Mermaid

Generates GitHub-renderable Entity-Relationship Diagrams showing:
- All entities and their relationships
- Cardinality notation (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys
- Organized by logical domain/bounded context

### Entity Catalog

For each entity (E-001, E-002, etc.), documents:
- **Description**: What this entity represents in business domain
- **Source Requirements**: Which DR-xxx requirements drive this entity
- **Business Owner**: From stakeholder RACI matrix
- **Data Classification**: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted
- **Volume Estimates**: Initial records + growth rate
- **Retention Period**: How long data is kept (GDPR requirement)
- **Attributes Table**: Type, Required, PII flag, Validation rules, Source requirement
- **Relationships**: Connections to other entities
- **Indexes**: Primary keys, foreign keys, performance indexes
- **Privacy Notes**: GDPR considerations

### GDPR/DPA 2018 Compliance

**PII Inventory:**
- Lists all personally identifiable information across entities
- Flags PII attributes for special handling

**Legal Basis for Processing:**
- Documents legal basis (consent, contract, legitimate interest, etc.)
- Per entity and purpose

**Data Subject Rights Implementation:**
- **Right to Access**: Subject access request endpoints
- **Right to Rectification**: Update mechanisms
- **Right to Erasure**: Hard delete or anonymization process
- **Right to Portability**: Export in machine-readable format
- **Right to Object**: Opt-out mechanisms
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: Restriction flag implementation

**Data Retention:**
- Active retention periods
- Archive periods
- Total retention (driven by GDPR, tax law, regulatory requirements)
- Deletion policy (hard delete, soft delete, anonymization)

**Cross-Border Transfers:**
- UK-EU adequacy considerations
- UK-US Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Supplementary measures (encryption, access controls)

**Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA):**
- Determines if DPIA required (high-risk processing)
- Privacy risks identification
- Mitigation measures
- ICO consultation requirements

### Data Governance Matrix

For each entity, identifies:
- **Data Owner**: Business stakeholder accountable (from RACI matrix)
- **Data Steward**: Person responsible for quality and compliance
- **Data Custodian**: Technical team managing storage/backups
- **Access Control**: Who can view/modify (roles/permissions)
- **Sensitivity**: Classification level
- **Compliance**: Applicable regulations (GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Quality SLA**: Accuracy, completeness, timeliness targets

### CRUD Matrix

Shows which components/systems can:
- **C**reate new records
- **R**ead existing records
- **U**pdate existing records
- **D**elete records

Helps identify:
- Unauthorized access patterns
- Security boundary violations
- Least privilege enforcement
- Separation of duties

### Data Integration Mapping

**Upstream Systems (Data Sources):**
- Source system name and type
- Integration method (real-time API, batch ETL, event-driven, file transfer)
- Entity mapping and field transformations
- Update frequency and data quality SLA
- Reconciliation process

**Downstream Systems (Data Consumers):**
- Target system name and type
- Sync method (REST API, batch export, event streaming, file transfer)
- Data latency SLA
- Retry logic and monitoring

**Master Data Management:**
- System of record for each entity
- Conflict resolution rules
- Data lineage tracking

### Sector-Specific Compliance

**PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry):**
- Cardholder data handling requirements
- PAN tokenization (full card numbers never stored)
- Encryption requirements (at rest and in transit)
- Key management (HSM, KMS)
- Access controls and audit logging

**HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):**
- PHI (Protected Health Information) handling
- HIPAA controls and BAA requirements

**FCA Regulations (Financial Conduct Authority - UK):**
- Financial data controls
- Record-keeping requirements

**Government Security Classifications (UK):**
- OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, SECRET, TOP SECRET

### Data Quality Framework

**Quality Dimensions:**
- **Accuracy**: Validation rules, reference data
- **Completeness**: Required field targets (e.g., "Customer email 99%")
- **Consistency**: Reconciliation rules across systems
- **Timeliness**: Update frequency, staleness tolerance
- **Uniqueness**: Deduplication rules
- **Validity**: Format conformance (regex, enums, ranges)

**Data Quality Metrics:**
- Measurable targets per entity
- Quality monitoring approach
- Issue resolution process with SLAs

### Requirements Traceability

Maps every DR-xxx (Data Requirement) to:
- Which entities satisfy the requirement
- Which attributes implement the requirement
- Rationale for design decisions
- Gaps (requirements not yet modeled)

**Example:**
```
| Requirement | Entity | Attributes | Rationale |
|-------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| DR-001 | E-001: Customer | customer_id, email, name | Store customer identity |
| DR-006 | E-001: Customer | [All PII fields] | GDPR: Right to erasure |
| DR-007 | E-003: PaymentMethod | [Tokenized PAN] | PCI-DSS: Secure card storage |
```

### Implementation Guidance

**Database Technology Recommendation:**
- Rationale for relational vs document vs graph vs time-series
- Cloud provider and high availability strategy

**Schema Migration Strategy:**
- Migration tool choice (Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic, etc.)
- Versioning and rollback procedures
- Zero-downtime migration patterns

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Backup strategy (full, incremental, transaction log)
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- Disaster recovery and failover

**Data Archival:**
- Active vs archived data policies
- Hot vs cold storage strategy
- Retrieval SLAs

**Testing Data Strategy:**
- Anonymization/pseudonymization for non-production
- Synthetic data generation
- Test data refresh process
